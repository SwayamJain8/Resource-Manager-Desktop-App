# Electron Course

This is the example code from the following freeCodeCamp course: <ToBeDefined></ToBeDefined>

It tackles setting up an electron app that displays system resource usages for your CPU, RAM and File-System
- using react and typescript
- with typesafe IPC communication
- with a hide-to-tray functionality
- with a custom menu-bar
- with a custom window-frame

It's tested using both E2E- (Playwright) and Unit-Tests (Vitest)
